# gitShare-Safari

gitShare is a small browser extension that allows you to share GitHub projects directly on Twitter. @LukyVj created the [original extension](https://github.com/LukyVj/gitShare) for Google Chrome and I adopted it to work in Safari as well.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the gitShare.safariextz file
2. Open the gitShare.safariextz file in Safari
3. Safari will prompt you to confirm the installation
4. Done!

I am going to submit the extension to the Safari Extensions Gallery. That will happen in the next days. When the process is done I will provide a link.

## Usage

When installed, the extension will provide a „Share“ button next to the three action buttons („Watch“, „Star“ and „Fork“) on every repository page. By clicking it, a tweet gets prepared including the repository’s title, its description and its GitHub page.
