# gitShare-Safari

gitShare is a small browser extension that allows you to share GitHub projects directly on Twitter. [@LukyVj](https://github.com/LukyVj) created the [original extension](https://github.com/LukyVj/gitShare) for Google Chrome and I adopted it to work in Safari as well.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the gitShare.safariextz file
2. Open the gitShare.safariextz file in Safari
3. Safari will prompt you to confirm the installation
4. Done!

## Usage

When installed, the extension will provide a "Share" button next to the three action buttons ("Watch", "Star" and "Fork") on every repository page. Click it and share the repository easily on Twitter and Facebook.
