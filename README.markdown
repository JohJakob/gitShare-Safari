# gitShare-Safari

_gitShare is a small browser extension that allows you to share GitHub projects directly on Twitter. [@LukyVj](https://github.com/LukyVj) created the [original extension](https://github.com/LukyVj/gitShare) for Google Chrome and I adopted it to work in Safari as well._

[![version 1.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.4-blue.svg)](https://github.com/JohJakob/gitShare-Safari/releases/tag/1.4)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the gitShare.safariextz file
2. Open the gitShare.safariextz file in Safari
3. Safari will prompt you to confirm the installation
4. Done!

## Usage

When installed, the extension will provide a "Share" button next to the three action buttons ("Watch", "Star" and "Fork") on every repository page. Click it and share the repository easily on Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

## Extras

Sometimes the Twitter and GitHub usernames of a person are different. Therefore gitShare-Safari will search for the Twitter username in the README to let your followers know who made this awesome stuff you're sharing.

All you have to do to use this feature is adding this line into your README: ```<!-- twitter: @username -->```. Don't forget to replace ```@username``` with your real Twitter username! You can use multiple usernames, too.
